# GlassFish Dockerfiles

This repository contains examples of Dockerfiles that can be used to build Docker images with [GlassFish](http://glassfish.org/).

## Usage

### Building locally

You can assume that running following command should build the images for you:

    docker build .

If it fails, please take a look at the `README.md`, there may be some instructions how to build it. If you think you found an issue -- [let us know](https://github.com/glassfish/dockerfiles/issues/new).

### Running

See instructions in `README.md` located next to the `Dockerfile` you want to build.

## License
